The text describes a system designed to learn causal rules from playing Atari games, specifically Space Invaders. It aims to achieve human-like performance by learning both the "level" (score) and the "time" taken to learn.

While it doesn't explicitly state why AI systems should be able to play games, it implies that game-playing can serve as a benchmark for testing an AI's ability to learn and adapt quickly, similar to how humans learn. 


AI systems are created to play games for several reasons:

* **To understand and replicate human intelligence:** Games provide a controlled environment where AI can learn complex decision-making, planning, and problem-solving skills similar to humans.

* **To develop new algorithms and techniques:** The challenges posed by game environments often lead to the development of innovative AI algorithms that can be applied to other domains.
* **To test and benchmark AI performance:** Games offer standardized benchmarks for evaluating the capabilities of different AI systems.

* **For entertainment and educational purposes:** Game-playing AI can provide engaging and interactive experiences for users, while also demonstrating the potential of artificial intelligence.

The text discusses creating AI systems that play games as a way to study and understand human-like performance, learning, and problem solving.
