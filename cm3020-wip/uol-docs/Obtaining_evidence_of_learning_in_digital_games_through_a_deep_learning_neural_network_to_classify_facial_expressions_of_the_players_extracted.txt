AI systems are created to play games for several reasons, including:

* **Understanding Learning:** Games can be used as testbeds to study how humans learn and make decisions. By observing player behavior and facial expressions, researchers can gain insights into cognitive processes.

* **Developing AI Capabilities:** Playing games requires complex problem-solving, strategic thinking, and adaptation. These are valuable skills for AI systems to develop, which can then be applied to other domains.
* **Testing and Improving Algorithms:** Games provide a challenging environment to test and refine AI algorithms. The dynamic nature of gameplay allows developers to evaluate how well their algorithms perform under pressure.

* **Creating Engaging Entertainment:** Ultimately, AI-powered game opponents can make games more fun and challenging for human players.
