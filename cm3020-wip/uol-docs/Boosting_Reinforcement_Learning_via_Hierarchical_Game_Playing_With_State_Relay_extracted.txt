The text does not explicitly state why to create AI systems that play games. However, it does mention several benefits of using game playing in reinforcement learning:

* **Improved Sample Efficiency:** Game-playing agents can learn more efficiently by retaining intermediate states and exploring a wider range of the environment.
* **Addressing Sparse Rewards:** Games can be designed with clear win/loss conditions, providing more frequent and meaningful rewards for the agent to learn from.
* **Hierarchical Learning:** Games can be used to train hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) agents, where higher-level policies set goals for lower-level policies, enabling them to solve complex tasks.

Therefore, while the text doesn't directly state "why" to create AI systems that play games, it highlights several advantages of this approach in the context of reinforcement learning.
