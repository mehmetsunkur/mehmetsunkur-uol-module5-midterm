The text explains how to create AI systems that play games as a way to train and improve them. It discusses using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to build Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). The game-playing aspect helps the IDS learn to identify and respond to different types of cyberattacks.

So, while it doesn't explicitly say "why" create AI systems that play games, it strongly implies that **game-playing is a powerful tool for training AI systems, particularly in complex domains like cybersecurity.**

The text describes a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach to Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). It explains how the system learns to identify different types of network attacks by playing a game against an attacker, maximizing its reward for correctly identifying malicious activity.

While the text doesn't explicitly state why create AI systems that play games, it implies several reasons:

* **Learning Complex Strategies:** Games often involve complex decision-making and strategic thinking. Training AI in a game environment can help it develop sophisticated strategies for identifying and responding to attacks.
* **Adaptability:** Game environments can be easily modified to simulate different attack scenarios. This allows the AI to learn and adapt to new threats, making it more robust and effective.
* **Evaluation and Benchmarking:** Games provide a controlled environment for evaluating the performance of the AI system. Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score can be used to benchmark its effectiveness against other IDS solutions.

Therefore, while not explicitly stated, the text suggests that creating AI systems that play games is a valuable approach for developing more intelligent and adaptable Intrusion Detection Systems.
