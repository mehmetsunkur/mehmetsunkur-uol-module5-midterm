AI systems are trained to play games for several reasons:

* **Testing and Benchmarking AI:** Games provide a controlled environment to test and benchmark the capabilities of AI algorithms. They allow researchers to evaluate how well an AI can learn, strategize, adapt, and make decisions under pressure.

* **Understanding Intelligence:** By studying how AI learns to play games, researchers gain insights into the nature of intelligence itself. Games often require complex reasoning, planning, and problem-solving skills, which are also important for human intelligence.

* **Developing New Algorithms:** The challenges posed by games often lead to the development of new and innovative AI algorithms. These algorithms can then be applied to other domains, such as robotics, finance, and healthcare.

* **Entertainment and Education:** AI-powered game opponents can provide challenging and engaging experiences for human players. They can also be used for educational purposes, teaching concepts like strategy, logic, and decision-making.
