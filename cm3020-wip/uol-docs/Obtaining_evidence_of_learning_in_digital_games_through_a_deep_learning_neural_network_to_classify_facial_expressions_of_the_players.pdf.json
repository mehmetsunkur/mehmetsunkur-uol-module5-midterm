A digital game have become an important option, as a pedagogical tool, for the development of skills currently required for the insertion of an individual in labor market. This paper reports a research on a computational architecture, based on the techniques and methods of Learning Analytics, to assist educators, who use digital games as pedagogical tools, in assessing the impacts of a player's emotional states on his motivation to play and, consequently, in their learning. Such architecture aims to identify data on players' emotional states, through their facial expressions, and cross them with data on the players \u2018actions, game events or states, which can evidence their learning. A deep learning neural network is used in the identification of the players\u00b4 facial expressions, through images of the faces of the students playing. The capture of these images is done by a webcam, installed on the computer where the game is playing, which is triggered by an intelligent software agent, according to pre-established conditions. This intelligent software agent also captures the data about the learning evidences. A software module, to analyze learning and the possible impacts of players' emotional states on their learning, completes the proposed computational architecture. The work was developed in the discipline on digital games applied to Education in a postgraduate course in Computer Science.",

        "text": "This paper reports a research developed in the discipline about digital games applied to Education in a postgraduate course of Computer Science. Its main objective was to propose and evaluate a computational architecture, based on the techniques and methods of Learning Analytics, to assist teachers, who use digital games as pedagogical tools, in the evaluation of the impacts of a player's emotional states and his motivation to play, in his learning. This architecture consists of: i) an intelligent software agent for collecting data of the players\u00b4 actions, game states and events, and also for recording images of the players; ii) a deep learning neural network, for the processing of these images, aiming to identify the emotional states of the players through their facial expressions, and iii) a software module for analysis of learning, based on the ECD approach. Data on players' facial expressions will allow teachers to check whether their emotional states were facilitators or barriers to learning while playing, and to help them to see if the game and its elements fit the teaching objectives.",

This approach provides a conceptual framework for learning assessment, based on diagrammatic models, which is able to support a wide range of types of evaluation, from the most traditional ones, such as essay tests and multiple choice tests, to types of evaluations considered more modern, for example evaluation of learning portfolios and simulations. This approach establishes that the learning obtained by the student is evaluate based on evidences gathered from different expressions of the student during the teaching-learning process. These models have already proved, in practice, to be useful to guide the collect of data and analysis of the data, that will evidence the lessons learned.",
