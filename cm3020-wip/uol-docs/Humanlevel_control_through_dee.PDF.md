Remarkably, humans andother animals seem to solve this problem through a harmonious combination of reinforcement learning and hierarchical sensory pro cessing systems 15 the former evidenced by a wealth of neural data minergic neurons and temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithms . While reinforcement learningagents have achieved some successes in a variety of domains6-%, their applicability has previously been limited to domains in which useful features can be handcrafted, or to domains with fully observed, low-dimensional state spaces. Here we use recent advances in training ~ neural networks? to develop a novel artificial agent, termed a Q-network; that can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs using end-to-end reinforcement learning. We tested this agent the challenging domain of classic Atari 2600 games'2 We demon strate that the Q-network agent; receiving only the pixels and algorithm, network architecture and hyperparameters.

We used the same network architecture, hyperparameter values (see Extended Data Table 1) and procedure throughout high-dimensional data (210 x 160 colour video at 60 Hz) as input to demonstrate that our approach robustly learns successful policies over a variety of games based solely on sensory inputs with only very minimal knowledge (that is, merely the input data were visual images; and the number of actions available in each game; but not their correspondences; see Methods).

## Evolution of the new vertebrate head by co-option of an ancient chordate skeletal tissue

A defining feature of vertebrates (craniates) is a pronounced head that is supported and protected by a robust cellular endoskeleton. In the first vertebrates, this skeleton probably consisted of nous cellular 'cartilage; which forms the embryonic skeleton ofallver tebrates and the adult skeleton of modern jawless and cartilaginous fish. In the head, most cellular cartilage is derived from a migratory cell population called the neural crest, which arises from the edges of the central nervous system. Because collagenous cellular cartilage sidered a turning in vertebrate evolution? Here we show that tissue with many of the defining features of vertebrate cellular cartilage transiently forms in thelarvae ofthe invertebrate chordate Branchiostoma floridae (Florida amphioxus) . We also present evi dence that during evolution; a regulator of vertebrate cartilage development; SoxE gained new cis-regulatory sequences that sub sequently directed its novel expression in neuralcrest cells. Together, these results suggest that the origin of the vertebrate head skeleton did not depend on the evolution of a new skeletal tissue; as is com an ancient regulator of cartilage differentiation was a major factor in the evolution of the vertebrate head skeleton. collagepoint key

cartilage in adults; at embryonic stages the head skeletons of all vertebrates consist ofa single typeofhistologically distinct cellular carti This embryonic cartilage consists oftightly packed polygonal or disc shaped cells that secrete a thin, homogeneous extracellular matrix material composed offibrillar collagen and chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans . While classical and modern histological examinations have not iden tified a clear homologue of vertebrate cellular cartilage in invertebrates; few invertebrates have cellular-cartilage-like endoskeletal elements. For 'example; among the protostomes, horseshoe crabs (Merostomata) cephalopod molluscs (Cephalopoda) and sabellid polychaete worms tribution suggests that these tissues evolved independently ofvertebrate cartilage; and ofeach other. Among the deuterostomes, both hemichor dates and cephalochordates (amphioxus) have stiff, acellular pharyngeal endoskeletons that incorporate fibrillar collagen In addition; amphi oxus has an oral skeleton that supports its tentacles (cirri) and that forms metamorphosis (Fig 1a-e) Although this oral skeleton is ensheathed in a thick integument that does not contain fibrillar col Unlike other deuterostomes, urochordates lack rigid endoskeletal elements despite their status as the sister group to vertebrates. living during

A recurring theme in evolutionary developmental ishow struc tures in distantly related taxa can arise via conserved developmental despite its unusual in adults, the oral skeleton of amphioxus develops via mechanisms that are homologous to those of vertebrate histology

Using new ods for the continuous laboratory culture ofthe Florida amphioxus (B. floridae), together with a protocol for artificially inducing synchronized we were able to obtain live amphioxus larvae at vari ous stages of oral skeleton development. We first stained these larvae with the classic histological stain for vertebrate cellular alcian blue; and found strong reactivity with the nascent oral skeleton stage revealed discoidal cells with vacuoles that were 'dividing per acidic extracellular matrix If, i). This histology is highly similar to that of the gill bar cartilage in embryonic lampreys (Petromyzon marinus) meth cartilage; specific large byan (Fig

Fibroblast factor (FGF)-mediated signal is a conserved essential regulator of cellular cartilage differentiation We thus exposed metamor phosing amphioxus larvae to SU5402 and UO126 (refs 11,12), inhibitors of FGF-mediated signalling that block cellular cartilage differentiation in vertebrates. Treatment with either inhibitor suppressed the forma tion oftheoral skeleton in metamorphosing amphioxus larvae (Fig. 2a-c and Extended Data Fig: Ic-h).

Most of the cellular cartilage in the vertebrate head is derived from NCCs. Amphioxus lacks NCCs andprobably forms its oralskeleton from the mesothelium that lines the anterior coeloms?o . This implies that the genetic program for generating cellular cartilage was primitively deployed in mesendoderm and later recruited by NCCs. The repurposing of ancient genes andgenetic programs is a recognized way in which novelty arises events are typically driven by changes in cis-regulatory sequences; changes in the function of transcription factors or a combination ofthe two. Inall vertebrates that havebeen examined, includinglampreys, SOXE transcription in NCCs is activated by the transcription factor TFAP2 These regulatory interactions are direct and involve the physical bind ing of TFAP2 and SOXE paralogues to SOXE enhancers in NCCs?122 Previous has shown that; despite new roles in NCCdevelopment; neither TFAP2 nor SOXE has acquired new DNA-binding properties This implies that the novel expression of SoxE in NCCs was driven by changes in SoxE cis-regulatory sequences rather than by changes in transcription factor function. To directly test this hypothesis; we performed an interspecific assay of SoxE cis regulation. To ensure that all of the relevant amphioxus cis-regulatory sequences were construct that contains the entire amphioxus SoxE locus and several and we tested this reporter in zebrafish (Fig- 3b). We reasoned that if changes in SoxE cis regulation were involved in the recruitment of SoxE to NCCs; then the reporter should recapitulate the expression pattern of endogenous SoxE in amphioxus (Fig. 3a) Alter regulation has been conserved across chordates; the reporter should be active in NCCs; as shown previously for amphioxus the neural tube and tail-bud region in early neurulae but not in migrat NCCs or chondrocytes at any developmental stage (Fig: 3c-Fand during option work flanking genes, ing

In human societies, cultural norms arise when behaviours are trans no 'comparable understanding ofthe process by which socially trans mitted behaviours might spread and inanimal Here weshow experimentalevidenceoftheestablishment of foraging traditionsin a wild bird population. Weintroducedalternative novel foraging techniques into replicated wild sub-populations of great tits (Parus major) and used automated establishment and term persistenceofthe seeded innovations. Furthermore, we used social network analysis to examine the social factors that influenced diffusion dynamics.

## Fundamental properties of unperturbed haematopoiesis from stem cells in vivo

plantation into immune- and blood-cell-depleted recipients. Single HSCs can rebuild the system after transplantation' Chromosomal marking  , viralintegration and barcoding' oftransplanted HSCs suggest that very low numbers of HSCs perpetuate continuous stream of HSCs during normal haematopoiesis; and the flux of differentiating allowing inducible genetic labelling of the most primitive Tie2 HSCs in bone marrow, and quantify label progression along haematopoietic devel During maintenance of the haematopoietic system; at least 30% or However, the time to approach equilibrium between labelled HSCs andtheir progeny is surprisingly a time scale that would exceed sustained by previously designated 'short-term' stem cells downstream HSC input. By contrast, in fetal and early postnatal life, HSCs are rapidly used to establish the immune and blood system. In the adult mouse, 5-fluoruracil-induced leukopenia enhances the output of HSCs and of downstream compartments, thus accelerating haematopoietic flux. Label tracing also identifies a strong lineage bias in adult mice with several-hundred-fold larger myeloid than lymphoidoutput; which is only marginally accentuated with age. Finally we show that transplantation imposes severe constraints on HSC engraftment; consist ent with the previously observed oligoclonal HSCactivity under these conditions. Thus, we uncover fundamental differences between the normal maintenance of the haematopoietic system; its regulation by challenge, and its re-establishment after transplantation. HSC fate mapping and its linked modelling provide a quantitative framework for studying in situ the regulation of haematopoiesis in health and long

The paucity ofHSCs has largely impeded direct measurements oftheir functions in situ. Todetermine fundamental properties (frequencies of active HSCs, fluxes between stem and progenitor compartments; residence time and expansion in compartments) of unperturbed steady genetic marking of HSCs in situ. As driver for Cre recombinase (Cre) we used the Tie2 (also known as Tek) locus; which is expressed in embryonic the Tie2 locus a gene encoding codon-improved Cre (iCre) fused to 16 two modified oestrogen receptor binding domains (designated MCM)' (Extended Data Fig: 1a-c) We chose this weakly inducible and tightly regulated system to prevent leakiness.

Within these downstream stem and progenitor compartments; the first marked cells emerged 4 weeks onwards (Fig 2c) Beyond 16 weeks, labelled HSCs labelledmyeloid cells Analysis of overall bone marrow cells further indicated that the label emanates marked HSCs (Extended Data 3a). few 'myeloid granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs); 0.006% megakaryocyte erythroid progenitors (MEPs)) in the bone marrow were also initially marked (Fig 2b, asterisk) , consistent with weak expression of Tie2 in myeloid progenitors (http:llwwwimmgenorg; data not shown) leading to direct; HSC-independent; labelling: Because of the limited life span of CMPs; GMPs and their progeny (Extended Data Fig: 4), the presence of that have arisen de novo from labelled HSCs. from arising from Fig Very

However, in divergence from the idea ofa continuous stream from the topofa haematopoietic pyramid, very low flux emanated from HSCs. While ST-HSCs are relatively exceedingly long-lived because ST-HSC self-renewal is almost sufficient to make up for the cell loss by differentiation. We hence identified this compartment as the primary source of haematopoietic maintenance in 'property ofST-HSCs readily explains the apparent HSC-independence ofhaematopoiesis notedin a recent report?^. However, to maintain the ST-HSC compartment in the run (>1 year), it requires continuous input from HSCs; we estimate that per 150 HSCs feed into this compartment (17,000 total HSC X 1/110 differ entiating per day). Hence; true HSC deficiency may go unnoticed for extended periods oftime while functionally impaired ST-HSCand MPP compartments would cause signs of acute bone marrow failure from long day rapid

Collectively; HSCs act in development as founding stem cells; and in adult mice as replenishing cells; ST-HSCs as term amplifying cells, and MPPs as intermediate-term amplifying cells.

Most haematopoietic cells renew from adult haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)'-', however, macrophages in adult tissues can self-maintain independently of HSCs'-7 . Progenitors with macrophage potential in vitro have been described in the sac before emergence of HSCss-13 , and fetal macrophages'3-15 can develop independently of Myb', transcription factor required for HSC'6, and can persist in the qualitative and quantitative contributions of HSC and putative that the vast majority of adult tissue-resident macrophages in liver (Kupffer cells) , brain (microglia) , epidermis (Langerhans cells) and (alveolar macrophages) originate from a Tie2+ (alsoknownas (EMPs) distinct from HSCs. EMPs develop in the sacat onic (E) 8.5, migrate and colonize the nascent fetal liver before and monocytes untilat least El6.5.

Therapy-related acute myeloid leukaemia (t-AML) and therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome (t-MDS) are well-recognized complications of cytotoxic chemotherapy andlor radiotherapy' There are several features that distinguish t-AML from de novo AML or 7,complex cytogenetics and a reduced response tochemotherapy'\_ leukaemogenesis. In particular, the mechanism by which TP53 by sequencing the genomes of 22 patients with t-AML, we show that the total number of somatic single-nucleotide variants and the per centage of chemotherapy-relatedtransversions are similarin t-AML and de novo AML indicating that previous chemotherapy does not t-MDSin which the exact TP53mutation foundat diagnosis was also present at low frequencies (0.003-0.7%) in mobilized blood leukoorbone marrow 3-6years before the development oft-AMLIt MDS, including two cases in which the relevant TP53mutation was tions were identified in small populations of peripheral blood cells ofhealthy chemotherapy-naive elderly individuals. Finally, in mouse bone marrow chimaeras containing both wild-typeand haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) the HSPCs pre suggest that cytotoxic therapy does not directly induce TP53 muta tions. Rather; support a model in which rare HSPCs carrying age-related TP53 mutations are resistant to chemotherapy and expand preferentially after treatment. The early acquisition of TP53 mutations in the founding HSPC clone probably contributes to the frequent cytogenetic abnormalities and poor responses to chemotherapy that are typical of patients with t-AMLIt-MDS. cytes Tp53+/ Tp53+/ they

Patient 530447 developed t-AML after an autologous stem cell transplant for refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma TP53, missense mutations of TET2 and NUP98, a silent mutation of CSMDI, and a subclonal KRAS mutation. Analysis of a leukapheresis obtained 6 years before the development oft-AML revealed that both TP53 mutant alleles were present with a variant allele fraction (VAF) at the same VAF and is probably passenger mutation. However, two potential driver mutations (TET2 and NUP98) were not detectable in the biallelic TP53 mutations preceded the development oft-AML byat least 6 years and antedated the development of the TET2 and NUP98 mutations (Fig; 2c). In a second case (unique patient number (UPN) 341666), a heterozygous TP53 R196* mutation was identified in mobi lized peripheral blood leukocytes 3 years before the development of frequency of 0.1%, preceding the acquisition of a RUNXI sample; sample sample

Indeed, we identified the SNAP25 G155S mutation in the previously banked bone marrow sample with a similar VAF (0.0029%) as that for TP53 Y22OC (Fig; 3c).

Gene transcription in animals involves the assembly of RNA polymerase II at core promoters and its cell-type-specific activation by However, how ubiqui ers exist and developmental and housekeeping 'regulation ters might exhibit an intrinsic specificity to certain enhancers? This is conceivable; as various core promoter sequence elements are differentially distributed between genes of different functions , in cluding elements that are predominantly found at either develop mentally regulated or at housekeeping Here we show that thousands of enhancers in Drosophila melanogasterS2 and ovarian promoters ubiquitously expressed ribosomal protein gene and another from developmentally regulated tran scription factor and confirm the existence of these two classes for five additional core promoters from genes with diverse functions. Housekeeping enhancers are active across the two cell types, while developmental enhancers exhibit strong cell-type specificity \_ Both enhancer classes differ in their genomic distribution; the functions of neighbouring genes, and the core promoter elements of these neighbouring genes. In addition; we identify two transcription fac tors developmental enhancers, respectively. Our results provide evidence for a sequence-encoded enhancer-core-promoter 'specificity that sep arates developmental and housekeeping gene regulatory programs for thousands of enhancers and their target genes across the entire genome. how gene genes*-10 .

Data sets originally obtained with coordinates on other assemblies were projected into the sacCer3 assem WWw.yeastgenome.org All regions ofthe sacCer3 genome were used for readalign ment but analyses including strand ratios and all rate estimates excluded the fol~461153 and any 100-nucleotide segment with mappability score of <0.9 (gem mappabilitys? with k-mer 100).

No statistical methods were uscd to predetermine sample size:

Rate estimates with compositional correction: Polymorphism and OJ rates were calculated separately for each nucleotide (A, T,Cor G)and the average ofthese for ratcs used as thc rcported or plotted mcasure for a nucleotide site or group of sites. This corrects for mononucleotide compositional biases that are abundant when sampling specific features of a genome. The between-species relative substitution rate calculation incorporates a compositionalcorrection. The rate estimates shown non-missing data.

Trinucleotide preserving shuffles. nucleotide of the sacCer3 genome was assigned to one of 64 categories based on the identity of that nuclcotide and its flanking nucleotides. A vector of transformations was produced by swapping the genomic coordinate of a nucleotide for one with an identical category chosen at random. Swaps between masked and unmasked sites (see above) were prevented. every sequence was substituted through the transformation vector; for a randomly rate or annotation used. This provides a compositionally well-matched null derived 95% confidence bounds and standard deviations on those null expecta tions. For human sites, shuffles were confined to sequences flanking the region of coordinates in the ENCODE 'Duke Excluded Regions andthose positions with a uniqueness score of <0.9 (gem-mappability ? with k-mer 100) were excluded from shuffles Every ing

By carrying the hyper-entangled Bell state measurement (h-BSM) on photons 1 and 2 to unambiguously distinguish one from the group of 16 hyper entangled Bell states, Alice can project photon 3 onto one ofthe 16 corresponding states. After Alice tells Bob her h-BSM result as four-bit classical information via a classical communication channel, Bob can convert the state of his photon 3 into the original state by applying appropriate twolocal unitary transformations qubit

Two-photon interference of spin-orbit composite state on a PBS. The input and output of photons 1 and 2 encoded in SAM and OAM on a PBS as shown in Fig can be summarized as follows: because the reflection the sign of OAM. Therefore; the output state for each of the input 16 hyper-entangled Bell states can be listed below: flips

## METHODS

Preprocessing. Working directly with raw Atari 2600 frames; which are 210 X 160 limages with a 128-colour palette; can be demanding in terms of computation and memory requirements. Weapply a basic preprocessing step aimed at reducing the input dimensionality and with some artefacts of the Atari 2600 emu valuc ovcr the frame cncoded and the previous frame. This was necessary to remove flickering that is present in games where some objects appear only in even frames while other objects appear only in odd frames, an artefact caused by the limited number of sprites Atari 2600 can display at once. Second, we then extract the Y channel, also known as luminance, from the RGB frame and rescale it to ing to the m most recent frames and stacks them to produce the input to the Q-function, in which m = 4, although the algorithm is robust to different values of m (for example; 3 or 5) pixel dealing being

Model architecture. There are several possible ways of parameterizing Q neural network Because Q maps history-action pairs to scalar estimates of their Q-valuc; the history and the action have bcen uscd as inputs to the ncural nctwork is that a scparate forward pass is required to compute the Q-value of cach action; architecture in which there is a separate output unit for each possible action; and only the state representation is an input to the neural network. The outputs correspondto the predicted Q-values ofthe individual actions for the input state: The main advantageofthis type ofarchitecture is the ability tocompute Q-values for all possible actions inagiven state with only a single forward pass through the network using

the neural network consists ofan 84 X 84 X 4 image produced by the preprocess con volves 64 filters of 4 X 4 with stride 2, again followed by a rectifier nonlinearity. This is followedby a thirdconvolutionallayer that convolves 64 filtersof3 X 3 with stride 1 followed by a rectifier. The final hidden is fully-connected and con sists of 512 rectifier units. The output is a fully-connected linear layer with a single output for each valid action. The number of valid actions varied between 4 and 18 on the games we considered. ing layer layer layer

Training details. We performed experiments on 49 Atari 2600 games where results were on each game: the same network architecture; learning algorithm and hyperpara meter settings (see Extended Data Table 1) were used across all games, showing that our approach is robust enough to work on a variety of games while incorporating only minimal fied games; we made one change to the reward structure of the games only. As the scale of scores varies greatly Clipping the rewards in this manner limits the scale of the error derivatives and makes it easier to use the same it could affect the performance of our agent since it cannot differentiate between rewards of different magnitude. For games where there is a life counter, the Atari 2600 emulator also sends the number oflives left in the game, which is then used to mark the end of an episode training: prior during training from during

The values ofall thehyperparameters and optimization parameters were selected by performing an informal search on the games Breakout, Seaquest, Space Invaders and Beam Rider. We did not perform a systematic grid search owing to the high computational cost. These parameters were then held fixed acrossallother Data Table 1. Pong

Following previousapproaches to playing Atari 2600 games, we also use asimple frame, and its last action is repeated on skipped frames. Becausc running the emulator forward for one step requires much less computation than the agent select an action; this techniquc allows the agent to play roughly k times more games without significantly increasing the runtime. We use k = 4 for all games. cvery having

Our experimental setup amounts to the following minimal knowledge: that the input data consisted of visual images (motivating our use of a convolutional network), the game-specific score (with no modification), number of actions, although not their correspondences (for example; specification of the up 'button') and the life count. using prior deep

The professional human tester usedthe same emulator engine as the agents, and played under controlled conditions. The human tester was not allowed to pause, save or reload games. As in the original Atari 2600 environment; the emulator was rewardachieved from around 20 episodes ofeach game lasting a maximum of5 min each; following around 2h of practice playing each game:

Evaluation procedure. The trained agents were evaluated by playing each game 30 times for up to 5 min each time different initial random conditions ('noop cedure is adopted to minimize the possibility of overfitting evaluation. The random agent scrved as a baseline comparison and chose a random action at 10 Hz sixth frame, repeating its last action on intervening frames, 10 Hz is the random agent to this frequency avoids spurious baseline scores in a handful of the at 60 Hz (that is, frame).

Algorithm. We consider tasks in which an agent interacts with an environment, At each time-step the agent selects an action a, from the set oflegal game actions, and the game score. In general the environment may be stochastic. The emulator's Xrelld Note that in general the game score may dependon the whole previous sequenceof actions andobservations; feedback about an action may only be receivedafter many thousands of time-steps have elapsed. from

Because the agent only observes the current screen; thetask is partially observed and many emulator states are perceptually aliased (that is, it is impossible to fully algorithm; which then learns game strategies depending upon these sequences. All steps. This formalismgives risetoa but finite Markov decision process (MDP) in which each sequence is a distinct state. As a result; we can apply standard rein large

The basic idca bchind many rcinforcement lcarning algorithms is to estimate the action-value function by using the Bellman equation as an iterative update; tothe is impractical, because the action-value function is estimated separately for each ment learning community this is typically a linear function approximator, but

Note that the targets depend on the network weights; this is in contrast with the each stage ofoptimization; we hold the parameters from the previous iteration 0; fixed when optimizing the ith loss function L(0,), resulting in a sequence of well defined optimization problems. The final term is the variance ofthe targets; which therefore be ignored Differentiating the loss function with respect to the weights we arrive at the following gradient:

Training algorithm for Q-networks. The full algorithm for training according to an #-greedy policy based on Q Because using histories of arbitrary above. The algorithm modifies standard online Q-learning in two ways to make it suitable for training large neural networks without diverging deep deep

Note that this algorithm is model-free: it solves the reinforcement learning task directly adequate exploration of the state space: In practice; the behaviour distribution is often selected by an #-greedy policy that follows the greedy policy with probability 1 = c and selects a random action with probability â‚¬ using

First, we use a technique known as experience replay? in which we store the over many episodes (where the end of an episode occurs when a termi nalstate is reached) intoa replay memory. During the inner ofthe algorithm (s,a,r,s') U(D), drawn at random from the ofstored samples. This approach has severaladvantages over standard online Q-learning First, each step ofexperience is potentially used in many weight updates; which allows for greater data efficiency . Second, Icarning dircctly corrclations between the randomizing the samples breaks these correla tions and therefore reduces the variance of the updates. Third; when learning on policy the current parameters determine the next data sample that the parameters samples will be dominated Itiscasy to scehow unwanted fccdback stuck in apoorlocal minimum, or even pooled loop pool from samples; ing by loops

In practice; our algorithm only stores the last N experience tuples in the replay memory,and samples uniformly at random from Dwhen performing This approach is in some respects limited because the memory buffer does not differ entiate important transitions and always overwrites with recent transitions owing to the finite memory size N. Similarly, the uniform sampling gives equal impor tancetoall transitions in the replay memory. A more sophisticated sampling strat egy might emphasize transitions from which we can learn the most; similar to prioritized sweeping

The second modification to online Q-learning aimed at further improving the stability of our method with neural networks is to use a separate network erating the targets y; in the Q-learning precisely, Cupdates we clone the network Q to obtain a target network Q and use Q for generating the that increases Q(spa ) often also increases Q(sr to oscillations or 'divergence ofthe policy.
