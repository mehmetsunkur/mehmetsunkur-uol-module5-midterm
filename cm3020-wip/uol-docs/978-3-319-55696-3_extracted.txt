The text does not explicitly state why to create AI systems that play games. However, it does mention several examples of AI systems playing games, such as Ms Pac-Man and Keepaway soccer.

It can be inferred from the context that creating AI systems that play games serves as a testbed for developing and evaluating new AI algorithms and techniques. Games often present complex challenges that require sophisticated decision-making, planning, and learning capabilities. By training AI agents to play games, researchers can gain insights into how these agents learn, adapt, and solve problems in dynamic environments.

Furthermore, game playing AI can have practical applications beyond entertainment. For example, techniques developed for game playing can be applied to real-world problems such as robotics control, resource management, and strategic decision-making.
