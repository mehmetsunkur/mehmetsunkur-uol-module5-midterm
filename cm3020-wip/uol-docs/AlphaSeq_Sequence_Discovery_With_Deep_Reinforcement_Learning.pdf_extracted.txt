The text describes using AI to discover sequences with desired properties, but it doesn't explicitly state why this is done.

It mentions that traditional methods for sequence design can be limited, so a more flexible algorithmic approach using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is proposed. 

While the "why" isn't directly stated, we can infer that creating AI systems to play games and discover sequences aims to:

* **Overcome limitations of analytical methods:** Traditional mathematical approaches may struggle with complex design criteria.
* **Explore a wider range of solutions:** Algorithmic search allows for discovering sequences that might not be found through traditional means.
* **Potentially find better solutions:** The AI system can learn and improve over time, potentially leading to sequences with superior properties compared to existing ones.

Therefore, the ultimate goal is likely to develop more efficient and effective methods for designing sequences with specific desired characteristics.

The text does not mention why to create AI systems that play games. It focuses on describing a DRL-based paradigm called AlphaSeq for sequence discovery and provides details about its implementation and applications in MC CDMA systems and pulse compression radar systems. 

Therefore, the answer is **not found**.

The text describes a deep reinforcement learning approach to sequence discovery called AlphaSeq, but it does not mention why one would create AI systems that play games.
