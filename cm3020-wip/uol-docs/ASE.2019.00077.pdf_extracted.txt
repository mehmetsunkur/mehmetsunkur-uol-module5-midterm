The text explains why AI systems are created to play games.

Here's a breakdown from the provided excerpt:

* **Testing:** Games are becoming increasingly complex, making testing crucial for quality assurance. Traditional testing methods are often insufficient.
* **Learning and Improvement:** AI, particularly deep reinforcement learning (DRL), can be used to automatically test games. This allows for more comprehensive exploration of game states and identification of bugs.
* **Beyond Traditional Testing:**  AI-powered testing goes beyond simply checking if a game works; it can learn strategies, identify weaknesses in game design, and even potentially suggest improvements.

Therefore, AI systems are created to play games to improve the testing process, leading to higher quality and more enjoyable gaming experiences.
