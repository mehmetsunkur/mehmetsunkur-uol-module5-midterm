The text describes a deep learning model for recommending bids in the Dou-DiZhu poker game, but it doesn't explicitly state why AI systems are created to play games.

However, we can infer some reasons from the context:


* **Research and Development:** Creating AI agents that can play games effectively is a challenging task that pushes the boundaries of artificial intelligence research. It allows researchers to explore new algorithms, architectures, and learning techniques.
* **Understanding Human Cognition:** Games often involve complex decision-making, strategic thinking, and adaptation to changing environments. Studying how AI learns to play games can provide insights into human cognitive processes.
* **Entertainment and Competition:** Game-playing AI can create engaging and challenging experiences for human players. It can also lead to the development of new game genres and mechanics.

Therefore, while the text doesn't directly answer "why" AI systems are created for playing games, it highlights some potential benefits and motivations behind this research area.
