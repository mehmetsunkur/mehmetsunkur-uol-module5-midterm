While the text discusses various reasons for creating AI systems that play games, it doesn't explicitly state "why" as a primary reason. The document focuses on explaining the mechanics and challenges of offline reinforcement learning in the context of game-playing AI.

Therefore, the answer is **not found**. 


While the text discusses various methods for creating AI systems that play games, it doesn't explicitly state *why* researchers create such systems. 

However, we can infer some reasons based on the information provided:

* **Understanding Intelligence:** Creating AI agents that can learn to play games complex games helps researchers understand how intelligence and learning work. Games often involve strategic thinking, planning, and adaptation â€“ qualities also found in human intelligence.
* **Developing New Algorithms:**  The challenge of creating game-playing AI pushes the development of new algorithms and techniques in machine learning and reinforcement learning. These advancements can then be applied to other fields.
* **Benchmarking Progress:** Games provide a standardized environment to benchmark the progress of AI research. By comparing how well different algorithms perform on the same games, researchers can track improvements over time.
