The text does not explicitly state why AI systems are created for playing games. However, it implies that game-playing agents based on deep reinforcement learning can be used to solve complex problems in dynamic environments.

For example, the article mentions using DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) to train an agent to navigate a confrontation scenario with obstacles and an opponent. This suggests that game-playing AI can be used for:


* **Testing and developing new algorithms:** Games provide a controlled environment to test and refine AI algorithms in complex situations.
* **Understanding decision-making processes:** Analyzing how AI agents play games can shed light on decision-making strategies and problem-solving techniques.
* **Developing real-world applications:** The skills learned by game-playing AI, such as planning, adaptation, and strategic thinking, can be applied to real-world problems in robotics, autonomous driving, and other fields.

While the article focuses on a specific application of game-playing AI, it highlights the broader potential of this technology for advancing artificial intelligence research and development.
