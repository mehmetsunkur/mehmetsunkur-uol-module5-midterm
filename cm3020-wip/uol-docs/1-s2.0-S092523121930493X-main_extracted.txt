The text explains why AI systems are created to play games, but it doesn't explicitly state the reason.

It mentions that training AI agents to play games can be beneficial for several reasons:

* **Data efficiency:** Games provide a structured and challenging environment where AI agents can learn complex decision-making processes with relatively small datasets.
* **Generalizability:** Skills learned in games, such as planning, strategy, and adaptation, can often be transferred to other real-world tasks.
* **Evaluation and benchmarking:** Games offer a clear metric for evaluating the performance of AI agents, allowing researchers to compare different algorithms and approaches.

Therefore, while the text doesn't directly state "why" AI systems are created to play games, it implies that game playing serves as a valuable tool for developing and testing intelligent agents with broad applicability.
