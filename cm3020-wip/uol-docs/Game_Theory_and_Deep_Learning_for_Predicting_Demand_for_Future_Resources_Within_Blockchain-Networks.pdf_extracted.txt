AI systems are created to play games for several reasons, including:

* **Understanding Game Theory:** Games provide a controlled environment to study strategic decision-making and the interactions between rational agents. AI playing games helps researchers test and refine game theory models.

* **Developing Learning Algorithms:** Games often involve complex rules and strategies, making them excellent testbeds for developing and evaluating machine learning algorithms.

* **Benchmarking Performance:** Game-playing AI can be used to benchmark the performance of different algorithms and architectures. Standardized game environments allow for fair comparisons.

* **Exploring Creativity and Problem Solving:** Creating AI that can play games at a high level requires innovative solutions and pushes the boundaries of artificial intelligence research.

* **Entertainment and Applications:** Game-playing AI can lead to the development of more challenging and engaging video games, as well as applications in other fields like robotics and autonomous systems.
