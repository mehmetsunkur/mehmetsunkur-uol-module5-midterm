The text explains that AI researchers are interested in creating AI systems that can play games because it's a good testbed for general intelligence.  It doesn't explicitly state *why* playing games is a useful goal, but it implies that the ability to learn and adapt in complex game environments could lead to more broadly intelligent AI systems.

The text does not explicitly state why to create AI systems that play games. However, it suggests that creating such systems can help us understand how to build more complex and intelligent AI agents.

The text focuses on a new method for evolving AI agents called Tangled Program Graphs (TPG). TPG allows for the creation of modular and hierarchical AI agents that can learn to play Atari games effectively. The researchers believe that this approach could lead to the development of more general-purpose AI systems in the future.

The text explains that AI systems are created to play games for a few key reasons:

* **Diversity Maintenance:** Playing different games helps prevent premature convergence of solutions and creates a diverse library of reusable code.

* **Benchmarking and Evaluation:** Games provide a standardized environment to test and compare the performance of different AI algorithms.
* **Understanding Complex Decision-Making:** Games often involve complex decision-making processes, which can help researchers understand how AI systems learn and adapt.

The text does not explicitly state why to create AI systems that play games. However, it does mention that creating AI systems for game playing can be used as a way to study and improve various aspects of artificial intelligence, such as:

* **Novel ways of improving cooperation and performance in ensemble classifiers.**
* **Managing team-based problem solving with symbiotic bid-based genetic programming.**
* **Exploring the use of genetic programming for tasks like the Rubik's cube and reinforcement learning.**
* **Developing hierarchical task decomposition through symbiosis in reinforcement learning.**

Therefore, while the text doesn't directly answer "why", it implies that creating AI systems that play games is a valuable tool for advancing AI research and development.

The text provided describes a research paper about using genetic programming to improve software. It mentions that the researchers used a program called "Triangle Program" as a test case and explored its search landscape.

However, the question you asked is **not** present in this text. 

Please provide me with the specific question you have about the Triangle Program or genetic programming so I can assist you further.

The text you provided describes a research paper about using the RANSAC algorithm to improve the robustness of genetic programming for symbolic regression tasks. It specifically mentions that the proposed method, called RANSAC-GP, can handle datasets with a high percentage of outliers (up to 90%).

Therefore, the answer to your question "Why create AI systems that play games?" is not found in this text. This paper focuses on improving the accuracy of symbolic regression models using genetic programming and addresses the challenge of outlier data points.

The text does not explicitly state why to create AI systems that play games. However, it does mention that Job Shop Scheduling (JSS) is an important optimization problem with a wide range of real-world applications in domains such as manufacturing, project scheduling, and cloud computing.

It further explains that using Genetic Programming (GP) to automatically design/evolve Dispatching Rules (DRs) for JSS has achieved some success.  The text focuses on improving the effectiveness of GP by considering time-invariance in DRs.


Therefore, while the text doesn't directly answer "why" create AI systems that play games, it implies that creating AI systems capable of solving complex optimization problems like JSS through game-playing scenarios can be beneficial for real-world applications.

The text does not explicitly state why AI systems are created to play games. However, it does mention that researchers have used genetic programming (GP) and geometric semantic genetic programming (GSGP) to solve symbolic regression problems, which often involve finding mathematical functions that fit a set of data points.

It's possible that creating AI systems that play games is seen as a way to:

* **Test and improve AI algorithms:** Games provide complex environments where AI agents need to learn strategies, make decisions under uncertainty, and adapt to changing conditions.
* **Explore new learning paradigms:** Game playing can push the boundaries of what AI systems are capable of learning and lead to the development of novel algorithms.
* **Create entertaining and engaging experiences:** AI-powered game opponents can provide challenging and unpredictable gameplay experiences for human players.

While the text doesn't directly address this question, these are some potential reasons why researchers might be interested in developing AI systems that play games.
