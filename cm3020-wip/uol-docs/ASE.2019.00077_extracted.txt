The text explains why creating AI systems that play games is beneficial for several reasons:

* **Bug Detection:** AI agents can be trained to identify bugs and unexpected behavior in games by exploring different states and actions. This can help developers find and fix issues more efficiently.
* **Testing Coverage:** AI players can explore a wider range of game scenarios and actions compared to manual testing, leading to better test coverage and potentially uncovering hidden bugs.

The text also mentions the use of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) combined with evolutionary algorithms for effective game testing.
