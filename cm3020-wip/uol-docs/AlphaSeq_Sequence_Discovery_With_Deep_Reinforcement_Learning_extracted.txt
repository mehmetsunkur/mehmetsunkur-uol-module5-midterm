The text explains that AI systems are trained to play games for several reasons, including:

* **Understanding complex decision-making:** Games often involve strategic thinking, planning, and adaptation, which can help AI learn these skills.
* **Developing algorithms for optimization:** Game playing requires finding the best possible moves in a given situation, leading to advancements in optimization algorithms.
* **Testing and improving machine learning techniques:** Games provide a controlled environment to test and refine new machine learning approaches.

The specific example in the text focuses on using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to train an AI system called AlphaSeq for discovering optimal sequences in communication systems. 




The text describes using AI systems to play games as a way to develop and test algorithms for complex problem solving, specifically mentioning AlphaSeq which is used to discover phase codes for pulse compression radar.

It does not explicitly state why creating AI systems that play games is beneficial. However, it implies that the process of training an AI to play a game effectively involves developing strategies, learning from mistakes, and optimizing performance - skills that can be transferable to solving real-world problems.
