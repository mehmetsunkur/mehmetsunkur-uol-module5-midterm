AI systems are trained to play games for several reasons:

* **Intrinsic Motivation:** Games provide a fun and engaging environment for AI agents to learn, explore, and develop problem-solving skills.

* **Benchmarking Progress:** Game playing serves as a benchmark to evaluate the capabilities of AI algorithms and track progress in artificial intelligence research.

* **Understanding Intelligence:** By studying how AI agents learn to play games, researchers gain insights into the nature of intelligence, decision-making, and learning processes.
* **Real-World Applications:** Techniques developed for game playing can be applied to real-world problems such as robotics, autonomous driving, and resource management.

The text provides examples of how different deep learning architectures have been used to train AI agents in various types of games, from simple Atari games to complex strategy games like StarCraft.

The text explains why creating AI systems that play games is important for research, but it doesn't explicitly state a reason for "creating AI systems that play games" in the sense of entertainment or commercial purposes.
