AI systems that play games can be created for a variety of reasons, including:

* **To advance the field of artificial intelligence:** Game playing provides a challenging and controlled environment for testing and developing new AI algorithms. 
* **To understand human cognition:** By studying how AI agents learn to play games, researchers can gain insights into human decision-making processes.
* **To create entertaining and engaging experiences:** Games are a popular form of entertainment, and AI opponents can provide a challenging and rewarding experience for players.

The specific reasons for creating an AI system that plays Bridge in this paper are:

* **To achieve superhuman performance:** The authors aim to develop an agent that can outperform the best human Bridge players.
* **To explore novel reinforcement learning techniques:** They introduce a new search method called Belief Monte Carlo Search (BMCS) which combines reinforcement learning with belief reasoning.
