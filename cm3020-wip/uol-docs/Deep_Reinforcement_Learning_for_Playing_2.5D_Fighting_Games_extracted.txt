AI systems are created to play games for several reasons:

* **Research:** Games provide a controlled environment to test and develop new AI algorithms, particularly in areas like reinforcement learning. 
* **Benchmarking:** Game performance can be used as a benchmark to compare the capabilities of different AI systems.
* **Entertainment:** Creating AI that can play games at a high level can be entertaining for both developers and users.

In this specific case, the researchers are interested in developing an AI system that can learn to play 2.5D fighting games like Little Fighter 2. This is a challenging task because these games require the AI to understand complex spatial relationships, timing, and combo sequences.


AI systems are created to play games for several reasons:

* **Testing and advancing AI algorithms:** Games provide complex, dynamic environments where AI agents need to learn and adapt. Success in games often requires sophisticated decision-making, planning, and learning capabilities.

* **Understanding human intelligence:** By studying how AI learns to play games, researchers can gain insights into the nature of intelligence, learning, and decision-making in both humans and machines.

* **Developing new applications:** The techniques developed for game-playing AI can be applied to other real-world problems, such as robotics, autonomous driving, and resource management.
* **Entertainment and education:** Game-playing AI can create challenging and engaging experiences for human players, while also providing opportunities for learning about AI and its capabilities.
