The text does not explicitly state why to create AI systems that play games. However, it suggests several potential benefits of such systems:

* **Understanding the impact of games on emotions:** The research aims to identify how different types of games affect players' emotional states. This information could be valuable for game developers, psychologists, and educators.
* **Developing tools for addiction prevention:** By identifying games that trigger negative emotions, researchers could develop tools to help people avoid or manage gaming addiction.

While the text doesn't directly answer "why" create AI systems that play games, it highlights potential applications in understanding human behavior and promoting well-being.
