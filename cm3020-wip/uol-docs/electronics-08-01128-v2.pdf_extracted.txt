The text explains that AI systems are trained to play games for several reasons, including:

* **Faster convergence rate:** AI can learn and improve at playing games much faster than humans.
* **Less computing resources:** Some architectures, like the RQDNN described in the text, require less computational power compared to traditional deep reinforcement learning algorithms.
* **Performance improvement:** AI systems can often achieve scores higher than human players.

The text provides examples of AI successfully playing games like Flappy Bird and Breakout.
