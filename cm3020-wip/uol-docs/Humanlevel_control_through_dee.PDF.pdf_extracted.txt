AI systems that play games are created for several reasons, including:

* **Understanding Intelligence:** Games provide a controlled environment to study how intelligence works. By building AI that can master games, researchers gain insights into learning, decision-making, and problem-solving.

* **Developing New Algorithms:** The challenge of creating game-playing AI pushes the boundaries of computer science and leads to the development of novel algorithms and techniques that can be applied to other fields.

* **Benchmarking Progress:** Games serve as benchmarks to measure the progress of AI research. As AI systems improve their performance in games, it indicates advancements in the field.
* **Entertainment and Education:** Game-playing AI can create engaging and challenging experiences for humans. It can also be used for educational purposes, teaching concepts like strategy and logic.

While this document doesn't explicitly state *why* the researchers created the DQN agent, it heavily implies that they were interested in understanding how to build artificial intelligence capable of learning from high-dimensional sensory input (like video game visuals) and making complex decisions in a dynamic environment.
