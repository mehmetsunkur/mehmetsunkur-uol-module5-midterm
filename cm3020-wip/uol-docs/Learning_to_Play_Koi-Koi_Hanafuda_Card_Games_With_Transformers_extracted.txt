AI systems are created to play games for several reasons:

* **Testing and Improving AI Algorithms:** Games provide a complex and challenging environment for AI to learn and improve. They require strategic thinking, planning, and adaptation, which are all important skills for AI systems.

* **Understanding Human Cognition:** By studying how AI agents learn to play games, researchers can gain insights into human cognition and decision-making processes.

* **Developing New Applications:** Game-playing AI can be applied to other domains, such as robotics, finance, and healthcare. For example, the techniques used to train game-playing AI can be adapted to train robots to navigate complex environments or to develop algorithms for financial trading.
* **Entertainment and Education:** Game-playing AI can provide entertainment and educational value. Playing against a strong AI opponent can be both challenging and fun, while also helping players to improve their own skills.

The specific reasons for creating AI systems that play Koi-Koi may include the desire to:

* **Explore the capabilities of transformer networks in handling complex card games.**
* **Develop a high-performing AI agent that can compete with human players.**
* **Gain insights into the strategies and tactics used in Koi-Koi.**
