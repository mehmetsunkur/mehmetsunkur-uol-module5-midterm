Researchers create AI systems that play games for several reasons, including:

* **To understand intelligence:** Games provide a controlled environment to study how intelligence works and develop algorithms that can learn and make decisions like humans.

* **To test and improve AI algorithms:** Games offer complex challenges that push the boundaries of AI capabilities and allow researchers to evaluate the performance of different algorithms.
* **To explore new applications for AI:** Game-playing AI can be adapted for other tasks, such as robotics, planning, and optimization.

The specific reasons for creating a game-playing AI system will vary depending on the researchers' goals and the particular game being studied.
