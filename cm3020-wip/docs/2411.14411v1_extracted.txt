Researchers create AI systems that play games for several reasons, including:

* **Testing and Benchmarking:** Games provide a controlled and challenging environment to test the capabilities of AI algorithms and compare their performance against each other.

* **Learning Complex Strategies:** Games often involve complex decision-making, strategic planning, and adaptation to changing circumstances. Playing games allows AI systems to learn these skills in a simulated environment.

* **Understanding Human Cognition:** By studying how AI agents learn to play games, researchers can gain insights into human cognitive processes such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making.
* **Developing New Algorithms:** The challenges posed by games often lead to the development of novel AI algorithms and techniques that can be applied to other domains.

Researchers create AI systems that play games for several reasons, including:

* **Testing and Benchmarking:** Games provide a controlled environment to test and benchmark the performance of AI algorithms. The rules of the game are well-defined, and success can be easily measured (e.g., winning or achieving a high score).
* **Learning Complex Strategies:** Many games require sophisticated decision-making and strategic thinking. By training AI agents to play games, researchers can gain insights into how these complex strategies emerge and develop.

* **Transfer Learning:** Skills learned by AI agents in one game environment may be transferable to other real-world tasks. For example, an AI that learns to navigate a maze in a game might be able to apply those navigation skills to robotics or autonomous driving.
* **Understanding Human Cognition:** Studying how AI agents learn to play games can provide insights into human cognition and decision-making processes.

Researchers create AI systems that play games for several reasons, including:

* **To test and improve AI algorithms:** Games provide a challenging and controlled environment for testing the capabilities of AI agents. By pitting AI against itself or human players, researchers can evaluate how well their algorithms learn, adapt, and make decisions.

* **To develop new AI techniques:** The complexity of games often requires the development of novel AI techniques to solve them effectively. These techniques can then be applied to other real-world problems.

* **To understand human intelligence:** By studying how AI agents learn to play games, researchers can gain insights into the nature of human intelligence and decision-making.

* **For entertainment and education:** Game-playing AI can be used to create engaging and educational experiences for players.
