I need to write a python script to a create an llm agent with langchain.
the agent should have the following properties:

   a. Import the necessary modules from the langchain library.
   b. Initialize an LLM (Language Model) of your choice (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face).
   c. Create a document loader to load the provided text document.
   d. Split the document into smaller chunks for processing.
   e. implement map reduce prompt to process the document in small chaunks. 
   f. extract the relevant information to the given subject from each chunk.
   g. combine the extracted information to form each chunk.
