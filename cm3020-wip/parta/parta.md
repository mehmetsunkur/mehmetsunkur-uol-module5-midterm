## CM3020 Artificial Intelligence Mid-term coursework specification

## Introduction

This document contains information about the mid-term coursework. You need to complete Part A and Part B. Part A is worth 30%. Part B is worth 70%.

## Part A

Write an essay about game playing AI. Your essay should answer the following questions. I recommend starting with these as section headings, but you might want to re-structure it later as you see fit.

- 1) Why do researchers create AI systems that play games?

To answer this question, explain how researchers justify the development of AIs that play games.

- 2) What are THREE possible application areas for AI systems that play games?

To answer this question, describe three possible application areas for gameplaying AI systems.

- 3) What do researchers think are the ethical problems with game-playing AIs?

To answer this question, discuss the ethical aspects presented by researchers about game playing AIs.

- 4) Are neural networks the best game players?

Based on what you have read, discuss this question, using evidence from the literature.

- 5) How reliable are my references?

Choose three of the references you used and evaluate the reliability of the reference.

You should answer each of the questions using information that you have found in the literature. To find relevant papers, you can start with the list provided in the AI game-player case study. To dig deeper you can search for your own references and/ or you can follow up the references at the end of other papers. Provide direct quotes from the research papers you have read to show how the researchers answer those questions and add your own commentary.

For example, 'Smith et al. evaluated game playing AIs based on their ability to consume pizza at 5am after staying up all night. They found that current generation systems in 2021 were not human-competitive. They said: 'since

the removal of CD-ROM drives from tower systems, the computers just have nowhere to put the pizza' ' [6]. I find that the pizza eating metric is flawed as it does not account for people who are lactose intolerant and computers do not eat pizza.'

Add an appropriately formatted list of references at the end of your essay.
