    "summary": "  General Game Playing (GGP) is a framework in which an artificial intelligence\nprogram is required to play a variety of games successfully. It acts as a test\nbed for AI and motivator of research. The AI is given a random game description\nat runtime which it then plays. The framework includes repositories of game\nrules. The Inductive General Game Playing (IGGP) problem challenges machine\nlearning systems to learn these GGP game rules by watching the game being\nplayed. In other words, IGGP is the problem of inducing general game rules from\nspecific game observations. Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) has shown to be a\npromising approach to this problem though it has been demonstrated that it is\nstill a hard problem for ILP systems. Existing work on IGGP has always assumed\nthat the game player being observed makes random moves. This is not\nrepresentative of how a human learns to play a game. With random gameplay\nsituations that would normally be encountered when humans play are not present.\nTo address this limitation, we analyse the effect of using intelligent versus\nrandom gameplay traces as well as the effect of varying the number of traces in\nthe training set. We use Sancho, the 2014 GGP competition winner, to generate\nintelligent game traces for a large number of games. We then use the ILP\nsystems, Metagol, Aleph and ILASP to induce game rules from the traces. We\ntrain and test the systems on combinations of intelligent and random data\nincluding a mixture of both. We also vary the volume of training data. Our\nresults show that whilst some games were learned more effectively in some of\nthe experiments than others no overall trend was statistically significant. The\nimplications of this work are that varying the quality of training data as\ndescribed in this paper has strong effects on the accuracy of the learned game\nrules; however one solution does not work for all games.\n",

Neural Fictitious Self Play (NFSP) is\nan effective algorithm for learning approximate Nash equilibrium of\nimperfect-information games from self-play without prior domain knowledge.\nHowever, it relies on Deep Q-Network, which is off-line and is hard to converge\nin online games with changing opponent strategy, so it can't approach\napproximate Nash equilibrium in games with large search scale and deep search\ndepth. In this paper, we propose Monte Carlo Neural Fictitious Self Play\n(MC-NFSP), an algorithm combines Monte Carlo tree search with NFSP, which\ngreatly improves the performance on large-scale zero-sum imperfect-information\ngames. Experimentally, we demonstrate that the proposed Monte Carlo Neural\nFictitious Self Play can converge to approximate Nash equilibrium in games with\nlarge-scale search depth while the Neural Fictitious Self Play can't.\nFurthermore, we develop Asynchronous Neural Fictitious Self Play (ANFSP).

Several classes of games considered standard\nin the literature, including coordination games, local interaction games,\nlattice games, congestion games, and party-affiliation games, are instances of\ngraphical potential games. This note provides several characterizations of\ngraphical potential games by leveraging well-known results from the literature\non probabilistic graphical models.

This service provides a basic\nmultilevel intelligent agent that can provide users with playing board games\ncommonly played in Indonesia.

Number of the distributions is equal to the multiplication of following\ncombinations: . Moreover, in this game that is played by four people, players\nare divided into 2 pairs. Accordingly, we cannot predict how the player uses\nthe dominoes that is according to the dominoes of his/her partner or according\nto his/her own dominoes. The fact that the natural intelligence can be a player\nin any level affects the outcome. These reasons make it difficult to develop an\nAI. In the article four levels of AI are developed. The AI in the first level\nis equivalent to the intelligence of a child who knows the rules of the game\nand recognizes the numbers. The AI in this level plays if it has any domino,\nsuitable to play or says pass. In most of the games which can be played on the\ninternet, the AI does the same. But the AI in the last level is a master\nplayer, and it can develop itself according to its competitors' levels.\n",

    "abstract": "The Werewolf game is a social deduction game based on free natural language communication, in which players try to deceive others in order to survive. An important feature of this game is that a large portion of the conversations are false information, and the behavior of artificial intelligence (AI) in such a situation has not been widely investigated. The purpose of this study is to develop an AI agent that can play Werewolf through natural language conversations. First, we collected game logs from 15 human players. Next, we fine-tuned a Transformer-based pretrained language model to construct a value network that can predict a posterior probability of winning a game at any given phase of the game and given a candidate for the next action. We then developed an AI agent that can interact with humans and choose the best voting target on the basis of its probability from the value network. Lastly, we evaluated the performance of the agent by having it actually play the game with human players. We found that our AI agent, Deep Wolf, could play Werewolf as competitively as average human players in a villager or a betrayer role, whereas Deep Wolf was inferior to human players in a werewolf or a seer role. These results suggest that current language models have the capability to suspect what others are saying, tell a lie, or detect lies in conversations.",

With AI, characters interact dynamically with players and environments, and FSM Models govern complex character behavior, the game experience is even more immersive. RPG Maker, one of the popular engines, simplifies the process of creating RPG games with an easy user interface. The implementation of the FSM Model is done through events and switches, directing storylines and character situations with structured logic. This study analyzes the application of FSM Model in MMORPG RPG games. Through the design, testing, and analysis stages, FSM proved effective in creating games that combine entertainment with learning. This game invites players to look for requirements and challenges to proceed to the next level. The result is an MMORPG game played on a PC with a Windows operating system, providing an educational and entertaining gaming experience.",

    "abstract": "General game playing artificial intelligence has recently seen important advances due to the various techniques known as 'deep learning'. However the advances conceal equally important limitations in their reliance on: massive data sets; fortuitously constructed problems; and absence of any human-level complexity, including other human opponents. On the other hand, deep learning systems which do beat human champions, such as in Go, do not generalise well. The power of deep learning simultaneously exposes its weakness. Given that deep learning is mostly clever reconfigurations of well-established methods, moving beyond the state of art calls for forward-thinking visionary solutions, not just more of the same. I present the argument that general game playing artificial intelligence will require a generalised player model. This is because games are inherently human artefacts which therefore, as a class of problems, contain cases which require a human-style problem solving approach. I relate this argument to the performance of state of art general game playing agents. I then describe a concept for a formal category theoretic basis to a generalised player model. This formal model approach integrates my existing 'Behavlets' method for psychologically-derived player modelling: \nCowley, B., Charles, D. (2016).

According to our review of relevant research, this is the first artificial intelligence framework that can perform self-playing with various computer players, improve win rates through historical game features, and predict multiple movements of multiple opponents in the card game Big2. An Android-based prototype of four-player Big2 game is implemented to verify the feasibility and superiority of Big2AI.

In Role-Playing Game (RPG) educational games, the activity is one of the main elements in shaping the experience. However, the absence of a model for activity design in educational RPG causes the resulting activities to be poorly conceived and lack of synchronization between gaming and educational principles. This paper discusses the design of an activity-based scenario, where the scenario is a collection of activities. Intelligent scenario directs in-game activity using dynamic rewards whose behavior is regulated using artificial intelligence with the Finite State Machine method. Then the resulting behavior is grouped into activity based on Appreciative Learning concept. Appreciative Learning is a concept in learning that focuses on positivity and an optimistic future. This concept consists of four stages, namely Discovery, Dream, Design, and Destiny. The intelligent scenario in this study is part of the Adaptive RPG For Education project, which contributes to the design of adaptive scenarios. Intelligent scenario produces an immersive experience in the form of activities with rewards that are conceptualized and synchronized between gaming and educational principles.",

    "abstract": "This research explores mediated ritual interactions in the form of pictures taken using a mobile device in tandem with two critical designs: Probably Not and World to GIF. We take our point of departure in Rich Ling\u2019s understanding of mobile interaction as a ritual of social cohesion and social bonding to explore sociotechnical interactions with mobile technology. By means of playful critical interaction design methods, we explore how deviance from the ritual of mediated interaction through taking pictures on the mobile phone may enhance our understanding of artificial agents. Building upon Ling\u2019s work, we mobilize the ritual aspect of mobile communication to open possibilities for imagining alternatives of seeing the world through artificial intelligence. We conclude by arguing that playful designs in mobile communication research may allow us to disassemble and reassemble mobile apps which enables critical reflection on the role of artificial agents in mobile rituals.",

    "abstract": "\n \n IW(1) is a simple search algorithm that assumes that states can be characterized in terms of a set of boolean features or atoms. IW(1) consists of a standard breadth-first search with one variation: a newly generated state is pruned if it does not make a new atom true. Thus, while a breadth-first search runs in time that is exponential in the number of atoms, IW(1) runs in linear time. Variations of the algorithm have been shown to yield state-of-the-art results in classical planning and more recently in the Atari video games. In this paper, we use the algorithm for selecting actions in the games of the general video-game AI competition (GVG-AI) which, unlike classical planning problems and the Atari games, are stochastic. We evaluate a variation of the algorithm over 30 games under different time windows using the number of wins as the performance measure. We find that IW(1) does better than the sample MCTS and OLMCTS controllers for all time windows with the performance gap growing with the window size. The exception are the puzzle-like games where all the algorithms do poorly. For such problems, we show that much better results can be obtained with the IW(2) algorithm, which is like IW(1), except that states are pruned in the breadth-first search when they fail to make true a new pair of atoms.\n \n",

    "abstract": "From the Publisher: \nGenetic algorithms are playing an increasingly important role in studies of complex adaptive systems, ranging from adaptive agents in economic theory to the use of machine learning techniques in the design of complex devices such as aircraft turbines and integrated circuits. Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems is the book that initiated this field of study, presenting the theoretical foundations and exploring applications. \nIn its most familiar form, adaptation is a biological process, whereby organisms evolve by rearranging genetic material to survive in environments confronting them. In this now classic work, Holland presents a mathematical model that allows for the nonlinearity of such complex interactions. He demonstrates the model's universality by applying it to economics, physiological psychology, game theory, and artificial intelligence and then outlines the way in which this approach modifies the traditional views of mathematical genetics. \nInitially applying his concepts to simply defined artificial systems with limited numbers of parameters, Holland goes on to explore their use in the study of a wide range of complex, naturally occuring processes, concentrating on systems having multiple factors that interact in nonlinear ways. Along the way he accounts for major effects of coadaptation and coevolution: the emergence of building blocks, or schemata, that are recombined and passed on to succeeding generations to provide, innovations and improvements. \nJohn H. Holland is Professor of Psychology and Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Michigan.

Moreover, we made available a server infrastructure for playing card games in perfect information and imperfect information playing mode, where students can evaluate their implementations of increasingly sophisticated game-playing algorithms in weekly online competitions, i.e. from rule-based systems to exhaustive and heuristic search in game trees to deep learning enhanced Monte Carlo methods and reinforcement learning completely freed of human domain knowledge. The evaluation of this particular course setting revealed enthusiastic feedback not only from students but also from the university authority.

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This paper undertakes a comparative analysis of the famous eighteenth-century chess-playing automaton known as Mechanical Turk and the Amazon microwork platform of the same name. The original Mechanical Turk was a life-sized automaton made in 1770 and publicly exhibited until the mid-1800s, and which played games of chess with the audience. Its movements were fully mechanical, but even more remarkably, it was promoted as the world\u2019s first \u2018thinking machine,\u2019 deciding each move of the chess pieces for itself. From the outset, it was widely assumed that the Mechanical Turk was a hoax, and that a human must be hidden inside the machine, directing the game. But it was a clever hoax whose trick was never discovered, and widely admired as such. Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk job platform functions in a similarly open way, this paper argues, as a sort of open technological hoax. Mechanical Turk provides a source of human cognitive labour that can be used to invisibly operate digital systems and programs that are widely assumed to be fully automated. Artificial intelligence is a twenty-first century thinking machine, it requires a human brain to make it work. Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk is a marketplace in which companies can hire piecemeal cognitive labour to patch gaps and train programs to keep those systems functioning. Providing what Jeff Bezos has called \u2018artificial artificial intelligence,\u2019 Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk, like Kempelen\u2019s automaton, both draws attention to and obfuscates the limits of automation and artificial intelligence. Taking the two iterations of the Mechanical Turk as rich cultural figures of automation for their respective periods, this paper will argue that the open secret of their artificial artificial intelligence is itself a form of misdirection that hides other, more successfully guarded secrets: the true extent of that labour, and the conditions in which it is performed.",

In order to improve the viewing experience of nonprofessionals, by intelligent target tracking technology, a system to capture athletes\u2019 movement process is proposed. It is possible to analyze the types of athletes\u2019 movements. In competitions or ball games, the system can predict the location of the ball or the player\u2019s drop point. The four different tennis courts, the player\u2019s motion capture, and the accuracy of the tennis landing prediction are further analyzed. The results show that when the athlete is facing the capture camera, the accuracy of motion recognition is high. In the absence of data on the playing field, the accuracy of the system for determining the position of the tennis ball fluctuates greatly. Therefore, this kind of system needs to have enough data to support it before it can be applied to fall point prediction.

    "abstract": "The trust game, a simple two-player economic exchange, is extensively used as an experimental measure for trust and trustworthiness of individuals. We construct deep neural network\u2013based artificial intelligence (AI) agents to participate a series of experiments based upon the trust game. These artificial agents are trained by playing with one another repeatedly without any prior knowledge, assumption, or data regarding human behaviors. We find that, under certain conditions, AI agents produce actions that are qualitatively similar to decisions of human subjects reported in the trust game literature. Factors that influence the emergence and levels of cooperation by artificial agents in the game are further explored. This study offers evidence that AI agents can develop trusting and cooperative behaviors purely from an interactive trial-and-error learning process. It constitutes a first step to build multiagent-based decision support systems in which interacting artificial agents are capable of leveraging social intelligence to achieve better outcomes collectively.

However, the best results in a game are highly dependent on the specific configuration of modifications introduced over several papers, each adding additional parameters to the core algorithm. Furthermore, the best previously published parameters have been found from only a few human-picked combinations, as the possibility space has grown beyond exhaustive search. This article presents the state of the art in RHEA, combining all modifications described in the literature, as well as new ones. We then use a parameter optimizer, the $N$-tuple bandit evolutionary algorithm, to find the best combination of parameters in 20 games from the general video game Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework. Furthermore, we analyze the algorithm\u2019s parameters and some interesting combinations revealed through the optimization process. Finally, we find new state of the art solutions on several games by automatically exploring the large parameter space of RHEA.",

This paper introduces a POET-Inspired Neuroevolutionary System for KreativitY (PINSKY) in games, which co-generates levels for multiple video games and agents that play them. This system leverages the General Video Game Artificial Intelligence (GVGAI) framework to enable co-generation of levels and agents for the 2D Atari-style games Zelda and Solar Fox. Results demonstrate the ability of PINSKY to generate curricula of game levels, opening up a promising new avenue for research at the intersection of procedural content generation and artificial life.

    "abstract": "A problem is a situation in which an agent seeks to attain a given goal without knowing how to achieve it. Human problem solving is typically studied as a search in a problem space composed of states (information about the environment) and operators (to move between states). A problem such as playing a game of chess has 10 120 possible states, and a traveling salesperson problem with as little as 82 cities already has more than 10 120 different tours (similar to chess). Biological neurons are slower than the digital switches in computers. An exhaustive search of the problem space exceeds the capacity of current computers for most interesting problems, and it is fairly clear that humans cannot in their lifetime exhaustively search even small fractions of these problem spaces. Yet, humans play chess and solve logistical problems of similar complexity on a daily basis. Even for simple problems humans do not typically engage in exploring even a small fraction of the problem space. This begs the question: How do humans solve problems on a daily basis in a fast and efficient way? Recent work suggests that humans build a problem representation and solve the represented problem-not the problem that is out there. The problem representation that is built and the process used to solve it are constrained by limits of cognitive capacity and a cost-benefit analysis discounting effort and reward. In this article, we argue that better understanding the way humans represent and solve problems using heuristics can help inform how simpler algorithms and representations can be used in artificial intelligence to lower computational complexity, reduce computation time, and facilitate real-time computation in complex problem\u00a0solving.",

Soil-transmitted helminth infection affects 1.5 billion people worldwide, and is the most prevalent disease among the Neglected Tropical Diseases. It is diagnosed by manual examination of stool samples by microscopy, which is a time-consuming task and requires trained personnel and high specialization. Artificial intelligence could automate this task making the diagnosis more accessible. Still, it needs a large amount of annotated training data coming from experts.In this work, we proposed the use of crowdsourced annotated medical images to train AI models (neural networks) for the detection of soil-transmitted helminthiasis in microscopy images from stool samples leveraging non-expert knowledge collected through playing a video game. We collected annotations made by both school-age children and adults, and we showed that, although the quality of crowdsourced annotations made by school-age children are sightly inferior than the ones made by adults, AI models trained on these crowdsourced annotations perform similarly (AUC of 0.928 and 0.939 respectively), and reach similar performance to the AI model trained on expert annotations (AUC of 0.932). We also showed the impact of the training sample size and continuous training on the performance of the AI models.In conclusion, the workflow proposed in this work combined collective and artificial intelligence for detecting soil-transmitted helminthiasis. Embedded within a digital health platform can be applied to any other medical image analysis task and contribute to reduce the burden of disease.",

Yet, this increased investment in game-playing AI (GPAI) techniques has not translated into a tangible improvement in the game-playing experience for our players. This paper is inspired by the positive impact of accessibility modes in recent games as well as previous calls in games research literature to focus on player experience. Responding to these calls, we propose utilizing GPAI techniques not to beat the player, as is traditionally done, but to support them in fully experiencing the game. We claim that utilizing GPAI agents to help players overcome barriers is a productive way of repurposing the capabilities of these agents. We further contribute a design exercise to help developers explore the space of possible GPAI-driven assistance methods. This exercise helps developers discover types of challenges and ideate methods that vary in magnitude and assistance type. We first apply this design exercise to explore the design space of possible assistance methods for the action platformer game Celeste. We then implement two of the discovered methods that target different challenge types in a Unity clone of Celeste. Through this implementation, we discover several additional research questions we must answer before GPAI-driven assistance methods can be truly effective. We believe this research direction furthers the discussion on how to utilize GPAI in service of the player experience and also contributes to the creation of more inclusive games.",

This setup poses a difficult challenge for current Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms, as they typically require much more data. This work investigates 3 versions of the Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm trained on a maximum of 2 levels from the available 5 from the GVGAI framework and compares their performance on all levels. The selected sub-set of games have different characteristics, like stochasticity, reward distribution and objectives. We found that stochasticity improves the generalisation, but too much can cause the algorithms to fail to learn the training levels. The quality of the training levels also matters, different sets of training levels can boost generalisation over all levels. In the GVGAI competition agents are scored based on their win rates and then their scores achieved in the games. We found that solely using the rewards provided by the game might not encourage winning.",

Impressive examples of this development can be found in domains such as image classification, sentiment analysis, speech understanding or strategic game playing. However, because of their nested non-linear structure, these highly successful machine learning and artificial intelligence models are usually applied in a black box manner, i.e., no information is provided about what exactly makes them arrive at their predictions. Since this lack of transparency can be a major drawback, e.g., in medical applications, the development of methods for visualizing, explaining and interpreting deep learning models has recently attracted increasing attention. This paper summarizes recent developments in this field and makes a plea for more interpretability in artificial intelligence. Furthermore, it presents two approaches to explaining predictions of deep learning models, one method which computes the sensitivity of the prediction with respect to changes in the input and one approach which meaningfully decomposes the decision in terms of the input variables. These methods are evaluated on three classification tasks.",

    "abstract": "Fighting videogames (also known as fighting games) are ever growing in popularity and accessibility. The isolated console experiences of 20th century gaming has been replaced by online gaming services that allow gamers to play from almost anywhere in the world with one another. This gives rise to competitive gaming on a global scale enabling them to experience fresh play styles and challenges by playing someone new. \nFighting games can typically be played either as a single player experience, or against another human player, whether it is via a network or a traditional multiplayer experience. However, there are two issues with these approaches. First, the single player offering in many fighting games is regarded as being simplistic in design, making the moves by the computer predictable. Secondly, while playing against other human players can be more varied and challenging, this may not always be achievable due to the logistics involved in setting up such a bout. Game Artificial Intelligence could provide a solution to both of these issues, allowing a human player s strategy to be learned and then mimicked by the AI fighter. \nIn this thesis, game AI techniques have been researched to provide a means of mimicking human player strategies in strategic fighting games with multiple parameters. Various techniques and their current usages are surveyed, informing the design of two separate solutions to this problem. The first solution relies solely on leveraging k nearest neighbour classification to identify which move should be executed based on the in-game parameters, resulting in decisions being made at the operational level and being fed from the bottom-up to the strategic level. The second solution utilises a number of existing Artificial Intelligence techniques, including data driven finite state machines, hierarchical clustering and k nearest neighbour classification, in an architecture that makes decisions at the strategic level and feeds them from the top-down to the operational level, resulting in the execution of moves. This design is underpinned by a novel algorithm to aid the mimicking process, which is used to identify patterns and strategies within data collated during bouts between two human players. Both solutions are evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively. A conclusion summarising the findings, as well as future work, is provided. The conclusions highlight the fact that both solutions are proficient in mimicking human strategies, but each has its own strengths depending on the type of strategy played out by the human. More structured, methodical strategies are better mimicked by the data driven finite state machine hybrid architecture, whereas the k nearest neighbour approach is better suited to tactical approaches, or even random button bashing that does not always conform to a pre-defined strategy.",

The competition proposes the challenge of creating controllers for general video game play, where a single agent must be able to play many different games, some of them unknown to the participants at the time of submitting their entries. This test can be seen as an approximation of general artificial intelligence, as the amount of game-dependent heuristics needs to be severely limited. The games employed are stochastic real-time scenarios (where the time budget to provide the next action is measured in milliseconds) with different winning conditions, scoring mechanisms, sprite types, and available actions for the player. It is a responsibility of the agents to discover the mechanics of each game, the requirements to obtain a high score and the requisites to finally achieve victory. This paper describes all controllers submitted to the competition, with an in-depth description of four of them by their authors, including the winner and the runner-up entries of the contest.

We also show how the extended language can be used to formalise general epistemic puzzles and how those can be solved using a mere game controller for GDL-III, that is, without requiring any game-playing intelligence beyond the ability to generate legal play sequences.",

    "abstract": "Game playing in artificial intelligence (AI) has produced effective algorithms enabling a computer to play two-person, non-cooperative, zero-sum and perfect information games such as checkers and chess. Game theory suggests solution sets for games, but does not shed much light on how to make moves in a game. This dissertation couples AI with game theory and determines ways for a computer to play multi-player games. The max$\\sp{\\rm n}$ algorithm is defined and analyzed for playing non-cooperative, n-person games. The max$\\sp{\\rm n}$ procedure finds an equilibrium point for a game and allows some pruning of calculated payoff values but not pruning of subtrees. An evaluation for representing a cooperative game is defined using the max$\\sp{\\rm n}$ procedure on all possible coalitions. This evaluation is used along with an earnings function in order to define the stability of a coalition and coalition structure. Finally, a solution algorithm is developed that is based on coalition stability for a computer to use in playing cooperative n-person games using look ahead, heuristic evaluation function, and back-up techniques. The solution algorithm gives a result that is sometimes in game-theoretic solution sets such as the core, stable set, kernel, and bargaining set. Potential applications for this work are in AI, conflict resolution, economics, mathematics, and social psychology.",

    "abstract": "General Game Playing is a field which allows the researcher to investigate techniques that might eventually be used in an agent capable of Artificial General Intelligence.\u00a0 Game playing presents a controlled environment in which to evaluate AI techniques, and so we have seen an increase in interest in this field of research.\u00a0 Games of imperfect information offer the researcher an additional challenge in terms of complexity over games with perfect information.\u00a0 In this article, we look at imperfect-information games: their expression, their complexity, and the additional demands of their players.\u00a0 We consider the problems of working with imperfect information and introduce a technique called HyperPlay, for efficiently sampling very large information sets, and present a formalism together with pseudo code so that others may implement it. We examine the design choices for the technique, show its soundness and completeness then provide some experimental results and demonstrate the use of the technique in a variety of imperfect-information games, revealing its strengths, weaknesses, and its efficiency against randomly generating samples.\u00a0 Improving the technique, we present HyperPlay-II, capable of correctly valuing information-gathering moves.\u00a0 Again, we provide some experimental results and demonstrate the use of the new technique revealing its strengths, weaknesses and its limitations.",
