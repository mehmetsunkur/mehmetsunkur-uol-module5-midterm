To effectively answer each of the questions in Part A of your coursework, you can employ the following strategies and resources to find comprehensive information in the literature:

1. **Why do researchers create AI systems that play games?**
   - **Search Scholarly Databases:** Use databases like Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, JSTOR, or ACM Digital Library to search for scholarly articles on the motivations behind AI in gaming. Keywords such as "AI game playing motivation," "purpose of game AI," and "game AI benefits" might be useful.
   - **Look into AI Workshops/Conferences:** Review proceedings from conferences like AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Interactive Digital Entertainment (AIIDE) or the International Conference on the Foundations of Digital Games (FDG) for insights into researchers' motivations.

2. **What are THREE possible application areas for AI systems that play games?**
   - **Literature Review Papers:** Look for literature reviews that discuss the broader applications of game-playing AI. Use search queries like "applications of game AI," "game AI industry applications," or "AI game technologies real-world uses."
   - **Industry Reports:** Industry reports and white papers from companies like Google DeepMind or OpenAI may outline real-world applications of AI technologies initially developed for games.

3. **What do researchers think are the ethical problems with game-playing AIs?**
   - **Ethics Journals:** Explore journals that focus on technology and ethics issues, such as the Journal of Ethics and Information Technology. Keywords could include "ethics of AI in gaming," "ethical issues in game AI," or "AI ethics concerns gaming."
   - **Books and Edited Volumes:** Consider books that focus on AI ethics, such as "The Ethics of Artificial Intelligence" or edited volumes on the impact of AI on society, which may discuss applications and issues in gaming contexts.

4. **Are neural networks the best game players?**
   - **Technical Papers on AI in Gaming:** Search for papers comparing different AI techniques in gaming, including neural networks. Useful search terms might include "game AI neural networks," "comparison of game AI techniques," and "game AI performance neural networks."
   - **Case Studies and Comparative Analyses:** Look for case studies or papers that compare the performance of neural networks against other game-playing strategies, such as rule-based systems or reinforcement learning approaches.

5. **How reliable are my references?**
   - **Evaluating Sources:** Choose three references and assess them critically. To evaluate reliability, consider factors such as the author's credentials, the publication source (peer-reviewed vs. non-peer-reviewed), citation counts, and potential biases.
   - **Cross-referencing:** Verify the claims made in your chosen references by cross-referencing with additional scholarly work to ensure the information is consistent and widely accepted.

For all of the above:
- **Citations and References:** Ensure you keep track of your sources and format them appropriately according to the required citation style (e.g., APA, MLA, etc.).
- **Quote and Paraphrase Wisely:** Use direct quotes for pivotal statements from your sources and complement them with your own analysis or interpretations.

By following these strategies, you'll be well-equipped to gather relevant and credible information to thoroughly address each of the questions in your essay.
