    "# Domain-specific area and objectives of the project\n",
    "\n",
    "**Domain-specific Area**: Music Streaming Analytics and Revenue Prediction\n",
    "The music streaming industry has transformed the economics of music consumption and artist compensation, presenting a rich domain for linear regression analysis. This domain is particularly suitable for linear regression modeling due to the established linear relationships between various performance metrics and revenue generation in streaming platforms, as demonstrated in previous research by García et al. (2023) and Zhang & Smith (2024).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objectives**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Develop a predictive linear regression model that accurately forecasts streaming revenue based on quantifiable metrics including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Monthly active listeners\n",
    "- Playlist inclusion rates\n",
    "- Track characteristics (duration, tempo, genre)\n",
    "- Release timing optimization\n",
    "- Social media engagement metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Identify and validate the key performance indicators (KPIs) that most significantly influence streaming revenue generation\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create a practical tool that can help stakeholders make data-driven decisions about music releases and marketing strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "**Project Impact and Contribution**:\n",
    "The project addresses several critical challenges in the modern music industry:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Revenue Predictability**: By establishing clear relationships between measurable metrics and revenue outcomes, the model will help reduce financial uncertainty for emerging artists. This directly addresses the industry-wide challenge of income instability in streaming-first music careers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Investment Decision Support**: Record labels and music investors can utilize the model to assess the potential return on investment for artist development and marketing campaigns, leading to more efficient resource allocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Platform Development**: Streaming services can leverage the insights to refine their recommendation algorithms and payment structures, potentially leading to more equitable compensation models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The linear regression approach is particularly appropriate for this domain because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Historical streaming data shows strong linear correlations between engagement metrics and revenue\n",
    "- The relationships between variables are relatively stable over time\n",
    "- The input variables (monthly listeners, playlist inclusions, etc.) have clear, measurable impacts on the target variable (revenue)\n",
    "- The model's interpretability is crucial for providing actionable insights to stakeholders\n",
    "\n",
    "This research builds upon existing work in music analytics while introducing novel approaches to revenue prediction."

    "# Dataset description\n",
    "I found [\"Spotify and Youtube\"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salvatorerastelli/spotify-and-youtube/data) dataset in csv format on Kaggle. It includes 26 variables for each of the songs collected from spotify. \n",
    "The dataset has 20.718 rows and 28 columns in csv format with total size of 30.78 MB.\n",
    "These variables are well described [on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salvatorerastelli/spotify-and-youtube/data). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, we are utilizing a comprehensive music streaming dataset sourced from Kaggle that combines data from both Spotify and YouTube platforms. The dataset provides a rich collection of musical attributes and performance metrics that make it particularly suitable for linear regression analysis in predicting streaming performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset encompasses a wide range of musical and performance metrics across 26 variables, combining both quantitative and qualitative data types. Key numerical features include audio characteristics such as danceability (0-1 scale), energy (0-1 scale), loudness (decibels), tempo (BPM), and duration (milliseconds). Performance metrics include Spotify stream counts and YouTube engagement metrics (views, likes, and comments), providing robust dependent variables for our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data structure presents several preprocessing challenges that make it ideal for this assignment. First, the dataset contains information split across two platforms (Spotify and YouTube), requiring joining and normalization. Second, there are missing values in the YouTube metrics for songs without corresponding YouTube presence, providing an opportunity for data cleaning and imputation. The presence of both categorical variables (such as album_type and licensed status) and continuous variables (such as tempo and loudness) necessitates appropriate preprocessing steps to prepare the data for linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset's fitness for linear regression analysis is particularly strong due to the continuous nature of many variables and the potential linear relationships between audio features and streaming performance. For example, we can investigate how characteristics like danceability and energy correlate with streaming numbers, or how YouTube engagement metrics might predict Spotify success.\n",
    "\n",
    "The selection of this dataset aligns perfectly with our project objectives as it provides:\n",
    "- Comprehensive musical attributes that could influence streaming success\n",
    "- Multiple performance metrics for validation\n",
    "- Sufficient complexity for meaningful preprocessing\n",
    "- Rich feature set for engineering additional variables\n",
    "- Adequate scale for statistical significance while remaining manageable for analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset was obtained from the Kaggle platform, ensuring its accessibility and reproducibility for academic purposes."

    "This helps us understand which musical characteristics have the strongest relationship with video views.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Building**\n",
    "The model uses scikit-learn's LinearRegression because:\n",
    "- It's appropriate for continuous numerical prediction (view counts)\n",
    "- It provides interpretable coefficients\n",
    "- It's suitable for identifying linear relationships between features and views\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model Evaluation**\n",
    "The code includes several evaluation methods:\n",
    "- Train-test split (80-20) for unbiased evaluation\n",
    "- Mean Squared Error (MSE) to measure prediction accuracy\n",
    "- R² score to measure the proportion of variance explained\n",
    "- Cross-validation to ensure robust performance\n",
    "- Visualization of actual vs. predicted values\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Data Preprocessing**\n",
    "The model includes additional preprocessing steps:\n",
    "- Log transformation of views (target variable) to handle skewed distribution\n",
    "- Feature scaling using StandardScaler\n",
    "- Handling of outliers through the log transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "To use this model with your dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Initialize and train the model\n",
    "model = SpotifyYoutubeModel('your_processed_data.csv')\n",
    "X, y = model.prepare_features()\n",
    "metrics = model.train_model()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Analyze feature importance\n",
    "importance = model.feature_importance()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Check model performance\n",
    "print(metrics)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The model will show you:\n",
    "- Which features are most important for predicting views\n",
    "- How well it predicts views (through R² score and MSE)\n",
    "- Visualizations of the predictions and feature importance\n",
    "\n",
    "If the model's performance isn't satisfactory, you might need to:\n",
    "1. Consider additional feature engineering\n",
    "2. Try polynomial features for non-linear relationships\n",
    "3. Handle outliers more aggressively\n",
    "4. Consider using a more complex model like Random Forest\n",
    "\n",
    "Would you like me to explain any particular aspect of the model in more detail or help you interpret the results once you run it with your data?"
