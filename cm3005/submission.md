# Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing the relationship between a song's audio characteristics and its cross-platform streaming success. The goal is to develop a predictive model that uses audio features to forecast a song's streaming performance across multiple platforms.

## Dataset Description

The project uses two datasets: "Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2024" and "Spotify and Youtube". The "Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2024" dataset provides a comprehensive compilation of the most streamed songs on Spotify in 2024, along with various metrics related to their popularity. The "Spotify and Youtube" dataset contains statistics for the top 10 songs of various Spotify artists and their YouTube videos.

## Data Preparation

The datasets were preprocessed to ensure data quality and consistency. Missing values were handled, and the data was normalized to prepare it for analysis.

## Statistical Analysis

The project performed statistical analysis on the datasets to identify key trends and patterns. Measures of central tendency, spread, and distribution were calculated to understand the characteristics of the data.

## Visualization

The project used visualization techniques to explore the relationships between variables. Scatter plots and bar charts were created to visualize the data and identify potential correlations.

## Machine Learning Model Building

A linear regression model was built using the preprocessed data. The model was trained on the "Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2024" dataset and evaluated on the "Spotify and Youtube" dataset.

## Validation

The model was validated using cross-validation techniques to ensure its accuracy and reliability.

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering techniques were applied to improve the model's performance. Polynomial features were added to capture non-linear relationships between variables.

## Programming Style

The project followed best practices for programming style, including code indentation, meaningful variable names, and comments.

## Evaluation of the Project

The project was evaluated based on its performance and results. The model's accuracy was assessed using metrics such as mean squared error and R-squared. The project's contributions to the music streaming industry were also discussed.
