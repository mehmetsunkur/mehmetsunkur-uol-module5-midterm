# Dataset Description

For this project, I have selected the "Spotify and Youtube" dataset. This dataset provides a comprehensive set of audio features and cross-platform performance metrics, making it an ideal choice for linear regression analysis.

The dataset contains 26 variables for each song, including track name, artist, album, danceability, energy, key, loudness, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, tempo, duration, streams, views, likes, and comments. These features align well with the project's objectives of predicting song success across multiple platforms using linear regression.

The "Spotify and Youtube" dataset is also suitable for linear regression analysis because it exhibits linear progression patterns in streaming success metrics, especially when properly normalized. Recent research has demonstrated the effectiveness of linear regression in modeling streaming performance across multiple platforms, making this dataset a strong candidate for this analysis.
